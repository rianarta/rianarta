### 🧠 Why I'm Leveling Up

💰 Want to Earn More
I’m aiming for a solid income — enough to live comfortably, support my family, and eventually reach financial freedom.

🌍 Want to Work from Anywhere (WFA)
I don’t want to be stuck in an office forever. I’m looking for more flexibility so I can work from anywhere and spend more quality time with my loved ones.

🔒 Want a Career That’s Future-Proof
I want to build skills that stay relevant for the next 5–10 years. No more feeling stuck or left behind by the tech world.
